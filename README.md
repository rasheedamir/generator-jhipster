[Sync a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork)

Grunt and Grunt plugins are installed and managed via [npm](https://npmjs.org/), the [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) package manager. 

####package.json
This file is used by [npm](https://npmjs.org/) to store metadata for projects published as npm modules. You will list grunt and the Grunt plugins your project needs as [devDependencies](https://npmjs.org/doc/json.html#devDependencies) in this file.

The `package.json` file belongs in the root directory of your project, next to the `Gruntfile`, and should be committed with your project source. Running `npm install` in the same folder as a `package.json` file will install the correct version of each dependency listed therein.
